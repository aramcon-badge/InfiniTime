This contribution guide is in progress, improvements are welcome.

### Code style

Any C++ code PRs should aim to follow the style of existing code in the project. 

Using an autoformatter is heavily recommended, but make sure it's configured properly. 

There's currently preconfigured autoformatter rules for: 

  * CLion (IntelliJ) in .idea/codeStyles/Project.xml
  
You can use those to configure your own IDE if it's not already on the list.

#### Linting errors and compiler warnings

Try to avoid any currently enabled warnings and try to reduce the amount of linter errors.

#### Spelling

Make sure you spellcheck your code before commiting it.

#### TODO, FIXME

Check before commiting that you haven't forgotten anything, preferably don't leave these in your commits.

#### Licence headers

You should add your name to the comma-space separated list of contributors if there's a license header.

### License

By contributing you agree to licence your code under the repository's general license (which is currently GPL-v3+).
